# Code Quality Analyzer Usage Guide

This guide explains how to use the Code Quality Analyzer tool and how to interpret the analysis results.

## Getting Started

### Web Application

The Code Quality Analyzer is available as a web application. To use it:

1. Access the application at your deployment URL
2. Click on the "Upload Code" button or drag and drop a file into the upload area
3. Wait for the analysis to complete (typically under 5 seconds)
4. Review your results

### Supported File Types

The analyzer supports the following file types:
- JavaScript (*.js)
- JSX (*.jsx)
- TypeScript (*.ts)
- TypeScript JSX (*.tsx)
- Python (*.py)

### File Size Limitations

For optimal performance, the analyzer works best with files under 1MB in size. While larger files will be accepted, they may take longer to analyze or may be truncated.

## Understanding the Results

### Overall Score

The analyzer provides an overall score out of 100 points. This score is a weighted average of six different categories:

- **Naming Conventions** (10 points)
- **Function Length & Modularity** (20 points)
- **Comments & Documentation** (20 points)
- **Code Formatting** (15 points)
- **Reusability** (15 points)
- **Best Practices** (20 points)

General score interpretation:
- **90-100**: Excellent code quality
- **80-89**: Good code quality
- **70-79**: Acceptable code quality
- **60-69**: Needs improvement
- **Below 60**: Significant issues to address

### Category Scores

#### Naming Conventions (10 points)

This category evaluates how well your code follows naming best practices:

- Descriptive variable and function names
- Consistent style (camelCase for JavaScript, snake_case for Python, etc.)
- Appropriate use of capitalization
- Avoiding overly abbreviated names

#### Function Length & Modularity (20 points)

This category assesses how well your code is broken down into manageable pieces:

- Function/method length (shorter is generally better)
- Single responsibility principle adherence
- Function complexity
- Parameter count and usage

#### Comments & Documentation (20 points)

This category evaluates the quality and quantity of code documentation:

- Function/class docstrings
- Inline comments explaining complex logic
- JSDoc/PyDoc style documentation
- Comment clarity and usefulness

#### Code Formatting (15 points)

This category assesses code readability and consistent styling:

- Consistent indentation
- Line length (avoiding excessively long lines)
- Consistent spacing
- Line breaks and code organization

#### Reusability (15 points)

This category evaluates how well your code can be reused:

- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle adherence
- Abstraction level
- Parameter flexibility
- Component isolation

#### Best Practices (20 points)

This category assesses adherence to language-specific best practices:

- Error handling
- Security considerations
- Performance optimizations
- Use of appropriate language features

### Recommendations

Each analysis includes 3-5 specific recommendations to improve your code. These recommendations:

- Are tailored to your specific code
- Focus on the lowest-scoring categories
- Provide actionable advice
- May include examples where appropriate

## Improving Your Scores

### Naming Conventions

To improve your naming conventions score:
- Use descriptive names that explain the purpose
- Follow language conventions (camelCase for JS, snake_case for Python)
- Keep names reasonably short but clear
- Be consistent throughout your codebase

### Function Length & Modularity

To improve your modularity score:
- Keep functions under 20-30 lines when possible
- Each function should do one thing well
- Extract repeated patterns into helper functions
- Use appropriate design patterns

### Comments & Documentation

To improve your documentation score:
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes
- Explain *why* code exists, not just what it does
- Document parameters, return values, and exceptions
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes

### Code Formatting

To improve your formatting score:
- Use a consistent indentation style
- Keep line length reasonable (80-120 characters)
- Use whitespace to improve readability
- Group related code together

### Reusability

To improve your reusability score:
- Extract duplicate code into shared functions
- Use parameters instead of hardcoding values
- Design functions and classes for reuse
- Use dependency injection where appropriate

### Best Practices

To improve your best practices score:
- Add proper error handling
- Follow security best practices
- Use language idioms appropriately
- Stay updated with modern coding standards

## Example Improvements

### Before (Low Score)

```javascript
function do_stuff(x) {
  // Do calculation
  let y = x * 2;
  console.log("Value of y: " + y);
  // More calculation
  let z = y * 3;
  console.log("Value of z: " + z);
  return z;
}
```

### After (Improved Score)

```javascript
/**
 * Calculates a value by multiplying the input by 6
 * @param {number} input - The number to multiply
 * @returns {number} The result of input * 6
 */
function calculateResult(input) {
  const intermediateValue = multiplyByTwo(input);
  const result = multiplyByThree(intermediateValue);
  
  return result;
}

/**
 * Multiplies a number by 2
 * @param {number} value - Value to multiply
 * @returns {number} Result of multiplication
 */
function multiplyByTwo(value) {
  return value * 2;
}

/**
 * Multiplies a number by 3
 * @param {number} value - Value to multiply
 * @returns {number} Result of multiplication
 */
function multiplyByThree(value) {
  return value * 3;
}
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How is the score calculated?

The score is calculated based on an analysis of your code against industry best practices. The AI model evaluates multiple aspects of code quality and assigns points according to how well your code aligns with these practices.

### Can I analyze multiple files at once?

Currently, the web application supports analyzing one file at a time. For batch analysis, consider using the GitHub Action integration, which can analyze multiple files in a single run.

### How can I interpret conflicting recommendations?

Sometimes recommendations may seem to conflict (e.g., "make functions shorter" vs. "reduce code duplication"). When this happens, use your judgment to find the right balance. Good code often requires tradeoffs between different quality aspects.

### What if I disagree with the score?

The analyzer is a tool to help identify potential improvements, not an absolute arbiter of code quality. If you disagree with a score, consider the specific recommendations and decide which ones make sense for your codebase and team standards.

### Can I customize the scoring criteria?

The web application uses fixed scoring criteria. However, when using the GitHub Action integration, you can adjust the minimum acceptable score threshold to match your team's quality standards.
